      <h1>France.</h1>
      <h2>My first taste of international travel.</h2>
      <p id="testP" class ="funParagraph">
         When I was a Junior in high school, I was given the opportunity to travel to France for 17 days.  My best friend and I spent a few days in Paris, but a majority of the trip was spent with a French family in the small town of Andrézieux Bouthéon in the Loire valley of central France.  
         From there, our daily journeys took us from the local school, to Montpelier on the Mediterranean coast, to the edge of the Alps in Annecy, and other small villages to truly experience a different country and its culture.
         <br><br>Below are a few places/experiences on my "bucket list"!

      <h1>Iceland</h1>
      <h2>Strange, Mysterious and Absolutely Fascinating</h2>

      <p class ="pininfo">I remember looking at a globe in our house growing up, and thinking about how fun it would be to visit Iceland.  I didn't know much about it at the time, other than it seemed greener
         than Greenland, and Greenland looked icier than Iceland.  One of life's great mysteries!  It appears to be a beautiful and enchanting mix of natural wonders, and culture rich cities. What's not
         to love about waterfalls, natural hot springs, abundant wildlife, and the Northern Lights? Currency fact &#126; Although part of the European Union, Iceland's currency is the Icelandic Krona, and not the Euro!(&euro;)

         <h1>Camino de Santiago</h1>
         <h2>The way of Saint James</h2>
         <p class="pininfo">
            Admittedly, I only found about the famous pilgrimage from the movie "The Way" with Martin Sheen. Depending on the route you choose, it can be anywhere from 300 to 800 kilometers
            through France or Portugal, and ending at Santiago de Compostela Cathedral in northern Spain. I can only imagine the life changing experience it would be to finish. While traveling through
            the smaller villages, you may be able to use American dollars, but definitely change for some Euros &euro;!

         <h1>Havana, Cuba</h1>
         <h2>The closest thing to time travel</h2>
   
         <p class ="pininfo">Since the embargo, Cuba has become a living museum of Classic Cars. I would imagine walking down the street in Havana is like stepping back in time. 
            Delicious food, great music, beautiful beaches, and a love of baseball! Maybe it's enchanting because "legally", Americans are still not supposed to travel there. Sometimes the forbidden fruits taste the sweetest. Only a short distance from 
            the Florida coast, but no &dollar;&nbspdollars here.  You must use the Cuban Peso.&#8369;

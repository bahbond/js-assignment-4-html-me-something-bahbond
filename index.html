<h1>Travel Pins</h1>
<h2>Mark Twain famously said, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.”</h2>

      When I was a Junior in high school, my grandparents made it possible for me to travel to France for 17 days.  It was a unique opportunity that I have always cherished.  Multiple days in Paris, but a majority of the trip was spent with a French family in the small town of Andrézieux Bouthéon in the Loire valley of central France.  
      From there, our daily journeys took us from the local school, to Montpelier on the Mediterranean coast, to the edge of the Alps in Annecy, and many other small villages. This one trip encouraged me to travel outside of my immediate scope.

     <h2>Iceland</h2>

      <p>I remember looking at a globe in our house growing up, and thinking about how fun it would be to visit Iceland.  I didn't know much about it at the time, other than it seemed greener
         than Greenland, and Greenland looked icier than Iceland.  One of life's great mysteries!  It appears to be a beautiful and enchanting mix of natural wonders, and culture rich cities. What's not
         to love about waterfalls, natural hot springs, abundant wildlife, and the Northern Lights?
